# <div align='center'/> Welcome to RevenueCat's Content Guide 

This guide is predominantly for RevenueCat employees, but anyone can view how we communicate in our content. 


## Adding a File

The guide contains markdown files. When adding a new file, name your file without spaces and a `.md` or `.markdown` extension.

<br/>

The files in this guide are prefixed with a double-digit to set order. Make sure your file starts with a number that will place your new content in the desired position (e.g.: `02`-) and change the prefixes of the other files to reflect this change in order.


## Managing Content 

When updating or adding content to our current pages, submit a pull request and add a reviewer. Please provide as much detail as you can when submitting your pull request.
