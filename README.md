## What is a Content Style Guide?

A content style guide is a set of standards for writing and formatting our content. Her[e](http://content.Here) RevenueCat at one of our pillars is being customer-obsessed. One we display this is creating a consistent experience for all individuals coming to RevenueCat. We always want to stick true to our goals in our writing.   

## When to Use Our Content Style Guide?

Our content guide can be used for all facets in RevenueCat where we are communicating to our customers. We recommend reviewing the [goals](https://github.com/RevenueCat/revenuecat-content-guide/blob/main/01-goals.md) and [voice and tone](https://github.com/RevenueCat/revenuecat-content-guide/blob/main/02-voice-and-tone.md) guides before writing documentation. When editing documentation or any writing the content guide can be a source of truth formatting and grammar needs. We also have a section on how to create tables, lists, photos, etc to comply with our standards.   

## Using our Content Style Guide

We have a quick checklist for editing documentation. Although this does not fully capture all areas of the content guide it highlights some key areas. 

### Content Check List

- [ ]  Review the RevenueCat [Voice and Tone Guide](https://github.com/RevenueCat/revenuecat-content-guide/blob/main/02-voice-and-tone.md)
- [ ]  Titles are capitalized with [title case](https://github.com/RevenueCat/revenuecat-content-guide/blob/main/03-grammar-and-mechanics.md#headerstitles---title-case)
- [ ]  Bold words/content are used for referring to UI elements or drawing emphasis
- [ ]  'select' is used in any instances of 'click'
- [ ]  Italicized words/content are used only for defining a word/phrase or referring to books, movies, and other full-length works.

## Adding a File

The guide contains markdown files. When adding a new file, name your file without spaces and a `.md` or `.markdown` extension.

<br/>

The files in this guide are prefixed with a double-digit to set order. Make sure your file starts with a number that will place your new content in the desired position (e.g.: `02`-) and change the prefixes of the other files to reflect this change in order.
