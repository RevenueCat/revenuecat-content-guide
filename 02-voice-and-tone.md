# <div align='center'> RevenueCat's Voice 
  
Our Voice is our writing style. We strive to provide a consistent experience for developers - it's how we show we're considerate about what they need to know. 

<br/>
  
 ## Some characteristics of our Voice at RevenueCat:

**Conversational**, we know when to be professional and when to be more casual.

**Action-Focused**, we're clear about the steps developers need to follow.

**Clear and Concise**, we don't use ten words when five are enough.

**Helpful**, we recognize our developers' problems and meet them with knowledge and compassion. 

 <br/>

### Conversational

✅  With your products set up in the stores, 
    you'll also need to set up a 1-to-1 mapping of the products in RevenueCat as well.

### Clear and Concise

Sometimes less is more; always strive to say the same thing in fewer words. It creates a clear and concise message, and it also shows we respect developers' time.

### Helpful

Although we are subject-matter experts of our product, we never want to use an I-Know-Better approach. Always acknowledge the developer's issue and try to provide a solution to their problem.

✅  Unfortunately, Apple's sandbox environment is notoriously flaky - 
    there are regular outages, and sometimes purchases can get hung up in their system. 
    Most of the time, this error is due to sandbox downtime, 
    but you can read about all of the causes for this error in our guide on error handling 
    here: https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/errors#--store_problem.  
  
    To clarify, there's nothing you as a developer or RevenueCat 
    can do to resolve these errors except retrying later.

## Voice vs. Tone 

Our Voice always stays the same, but our Tone will change based on the situation. Think of it this way: if you're whispering or yelling, your voice has stayed the same - you just changed your tone. 

<br/>
  
  | Voice (doesn't change)  | Tone (varies based on situation)|     
|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|
|Conversational       |     Friendly      |
| Action-Focused       |    Urgent         |
|Clear and Concise   |Encouraging        |
 | Helpful            |  Casual           |

<br/>

If a developer is reaching out to us facing an integration problem, they're likely stressed. They're probably looking for a fast and easy-to-understand solution - so being direct and concise is best here. However, if the developer is reading through documentation or comes to us after shipping their app, we can choose to be more friendly and use exclamation points!

## More About Voice and Tone
  
  
 <br/>

### Active Voice
When writing, it's best to use active voice and avoid passive voice. We use active voice to convey a strong and clear tone. It allows us to write concisely and efficiently, creating more engaging content that makes it easier to follow along.

Active voice is when the subject of a sentence performs the verb’s action. Passive voice is when the verb acts on the subject.

 ### Call to Action
A call to action is an invitation to developers to take the desired action. We use strong command verbs that encourage the developer to take the next step.
